# KeySwitch
This is a simple AT Switch Interface based on the ATMakers PCB design and a Feather Trinket M0

This allows keystrokes to be sent to a PC, MAC, or any USB HID central device based on the code and configuration files
on the Trinket device itself.

This is a CircuitPython project and many thanks to Adafruit and its staff and community for their help.
